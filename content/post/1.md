[Go](https://golang.org/) has been my go-to side project language for quite some time now (since before v1.0), and when I started the [Matasano crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com) it seemed like a perfect fit for a number of reasons - it doesn't force me to write a lot of boilerplate, is low-level enough to allow implementing your own crypto primitives and it comes with a rich standard library (I am looking at you Scala). I made my way through the first set and while solving one of the problems I wanted to run a certain function in parallel.

The simplest way of making this use all CPU cores is to run each calculation in it's own goroutine, and the standard way tracking if all of them completed is using a sync.WaitGroup - for simplicity this code assumes we only care about side effects (printing) and do not consume the result:
{{<highlight go>}}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for _, n := range numbers {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(in int) {
			fmt.Printf("%d: %d\n", in, cpuIntensive(in))
			wg.Done()
		}(n)
	}
	wg.Wait()
}

// does something CPU intensive
func cpuIntensive(n int) int {
	return n * n * n
}
{{</highlight>}}
This works fine, but wouldn't it be nice to extract the anonymous function to make things more readable / testable:

{{<highlight go>}}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	numbers := []int{1, 10, 100, 1000}
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for _, n := range numbers {
		wg.Add(1)
		go runInGoroutine(n, wg)
	}
	wg.Wait()
}

func runInGoroutine(in int, wg sync.WaitGroup) {
	fmt.Printf("cpuIntensive(%d): %d\n", in, cpuIntensive(in))
	wg.Done()
}

// does something CPU intensive
func cpuIntensive(n int) int {
	return n * n * n
}
{{</highlight>}}
Turns out it's not that simple - this code completes the calculations but fails with
`
fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!
`

What is happening here - we only extracted a function? Go is kind enough to let us know that our program (or more correctly all goroutines we created) are deadlocked - but why? Our simple refactoring wasn't correct - we changed the way the code run in goroutine uses the sync.WaitGroup variable. Previously it closed (as in [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming))]) over it, now it takes it as a parameter. What happens here is that the WaitGroup is passed by value, meaning each goroutine gets a copy of the WaitGroup. This means that when we call wg.Wait() we are waiting on a WaitGroup that will never be modified. The fix is simple - we pass a pointer to all goroutines, letting WaitGroup take care of concurrent modifications:
{{<highlight go "hl_lines=13 18">}}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	numbers := []int{1, 10, 100, 1000}
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for _, n := range numbers {
		wg.Add(1)
		go runInGoroutine(n, &wg)
	}
	wg.Wait()
}

func runInGoroutine(in int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	fmt.Printf("cpuIntensive(%d): %d\n", in, cpuIntensive(in))
	wg.Done()
}

// does something CPU intensive
func cpuIntensive(n int) int {
	return n * n * n
}

Point to remember - whenever you are mutating parameters (or for that matter [method receivers](https://tour.golang.org/methods/3)) make sure you are referencing the original object, not a copy.
