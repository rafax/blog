[Go](https://golang.org/) was my go-to side project language for the last few years (since before v1.0), so when I started the [Matasano crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com) it seemed like a perfect fit for a number of reasons - little boilerplate, low-level (compared to ex. Scala), rich standard library.
