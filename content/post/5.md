Many of the projects I do at work and in my free time require two components to exchange and validate some sort of tokens - whether it's OAuth2 access tokens, session cookies, API keys or other types of data that is generally passed as a string and represents information about the user.

We generally apply one on two approaches to issuing and validating tokens:

* persist them in some sort of database and load them on every request
* encrypt and sign them and verify them cryptographically

First way allows us to make the token smaller (as additional information will generally be stored in the DB) and makes it easier to expire them, but it requires DB lookups and API calls. Second approach means the tokens are larger and harder to expire, but it doesn't require a DB and (in case of assymetric encryption) can save API calls.

I want to compare the performance of those two approaches, so I plan to develop a simple API project that will issue tokens and allow clients to validate them using an API call. Let's assume users can purchase subscriptions in our book library, and whenever a purchase is completed we issue a token that can be used to get subscription expiry date, it's level (say 'All books' or 'Books older than 1 year') and platforms for which it is available.

API will have two endpoints - one for issuing tokens and one for verifying them. We will need to associate a realistic set of prop


First iteration will include:
* UUIDs stored in Postgres
* UUIDs stored in Redis
* JW
